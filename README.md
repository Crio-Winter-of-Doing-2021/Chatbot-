### Live Demo (Please Give it few seconds to load the gif ðŸ˜€)
![](livedemo.gif)


This is a short gif to show how it is working, as you show when I moved to stocks page it asked me questions related to stocks. Similarly based on page context it will show the questions and also users can register, in that user context will also be used.

The UI is simple, will improve it but the chatbot functionality was the main focus.
We have also made a panel to edit and make new FAQs which is shown in the full demo.

Also, Users can directly type questions in the chatbot text and even if the question is similar in context to present FAQs it will answer it, becuase we have trained the chatbot using AI/ML based library called Chatterbot.
